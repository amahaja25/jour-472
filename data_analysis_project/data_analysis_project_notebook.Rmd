# The data frame has 430584 rows and 8 columns

# One limitation is that it might be difficult to define each industry just based on agency, and we do not know what each code in the category column means or stands for. In terms of timeframe, we do not have limitations as our data spans from 2008 to 2024.

# Fiscal 2022 was $36,656,748,838
